                        I was born on May 1st 1999. and have always felt a strong passion towards
                        computers. After graduating high school as an engineer and participating in
                        various competitions in mechanics and mechanical constructions I decided to
                        attend Faculty of organization and informatics. I earned my Bachelorâ€™s
                        degree in September 2022. and I am currently doing my graduate study.

                        I have been working on my development skills for years, seriously focusing
                        on frontend development in 2020. Since then I have worked in various
                        environments with different tools. I also have 7 months of professional
                        experience in frontend development where I primarily used Next.js, React and
                        React Native.
