            I was born on May 1st 1999 and have always felt a strong passion towards computers.
            After graduating high school as a mechanical engineer and participating in various
            competitions in mechanics and mechanical constructions, I decided to enroll at Faculty
            of Organization and Informatics in Varazdin. I earned my Bachelorâ€™s degree in September
            2022 and I am currently working on my master's degree.

            I have been working on my development skills for years, seriously focusing on frontend
            development in 2020. Since then I have worked in various environments with different
            tools. I also have a year and a half of professional experience in frontend development
            where I primarily used Next.js, React and React Native. Other than frontend development,
            I'm also working on my backend skills primarily using Laravel and Node.
